# adc_udma

The purpose of this project is to implement both the uDMA and ADC of the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller without using the Texas Instrument API in order tounderstand how to get a better understanding of how each works.

This project implements the ADC sampling the internal temperature sensor of the TM4C123 using uDMA to transfer data between buffers using Ping-Pong mode.
